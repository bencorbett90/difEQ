Below are some new features to be implimented in future updates in no particular order. If you have strong feelings about what
should be added first or an idea for a new feature let me know!

Allow a help file to be printed upon request

Allow animation of the position as a function of t.

Package into 1 application for download

Break the source code into separate files for clarity, including putting the coefficient functions in a separate file, and impliment
make so that the entire package doesn't need to be recompiled simply to change the equation.

Variable time step, determined partially by a user defined error function (would be dependent on the particular equation).

Multithreading support / general computing speedup

Speedup data exchange between C and python potentially using piping or writing the difEQ.c as a precompiled python library.

Rewrite graphUtility.py so that it can configure the input file and call different versions of difEQ.
